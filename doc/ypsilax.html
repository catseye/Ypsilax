<h1>Ypsilax</h1>

<p>Language version 1.1, distribution revision 2011.0428.<br/>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p><b>Ypsilax</b> is a minimal, non-deterministic, reflective, two-dimensional
grid-rewriting language.  Ypsilax is a descendent of Zirgulax, which was an earlier but
similar idea which used a hexnet instead of a grid.</p>

<p>An Ypsilax source file is One Big Playfield.  This playfield is not
semantically symmetrical; things closer to the 'top' of the playfield have a higher
'precendence' than the things close to the 'bottom'.  (I experimented
with colours and boundaries, and found having a 'sloping' playfield was
much easier to implement.)</p>

<p>[Implementation note.   The source for the reference implementation
is only about 5K of Perl code, and much of that is taken up by the license!]</p>

<p>A rewriting rule in Ypsilax looks like this:</p>

<pre>  (  )
   AB
</pre>

<p>Rules are always twice as wide as they are high.  This particular rule, which is
two cells wide by one cell high, says that it is OK to replace any A found
below this rule with a B.</p>

<p>Ypsilax is totally non-determinstic, like <a href="/projects/thue/">Thue</a>.
Each reduction consists of picking a rule by an unspecified method —
for all you know, it is selected completely at random — and attempting to apply
it to some part of the playfield below the rule, again chosen by means unknown.
When this suceeds, that part of the playfield is rewritten.</p>

<p>[Implementation note: in fact, the reference implementation does indeed select rules
and places to apply them using Perl's pseudo-random number generator.  Also, the
interpreter  dumps an image of the playfield to <tt>stdout</tt> whenever a rewrite
occurs, for some jolly good entertainment, but this is not specified as part of the language
semantics proper.]</p>

<p>Ypsilax is reflective.  This means that you can write rules which rewrite
other rules.  For example, you could write the following rule above the
previously noted rule, which would rewrite it:</p>

<pre>  (        )
   (  )(  )
    AB  CD
</pre>

<p>Note that this rule is, in fact, four cells high, as it is eight cells across.</p>

<p>However, there is nothing stopping these 'embedded' rules
from also being randomly picked and applied by some rule that
may occur above them.  To get around that
we can 'escape' the rules-to-be-matched-instead-of-obeyed:</p>

<pre>  (\   \   )
   (  )(  )
    AB  CD
</pre>

<p>The backslashes do not affect the semantics of the parentheses
as 'define rule'; however they do prevent rewrites on the cells
immediately below them.</p>

<p>Finally, Ypsilax just wouldn't be a proper constraint-based language
without some form of pattern-matching.  (<em>In 1.1: Updated to agree with
existing implementation and examples</em>)
The wildcard character in any given rule is whatever character appears just
to the left of the <code>)</code> that delimits that rule on the right,
as long as that character is not blank space.
Whereever this character appears in the left-hand side of the rule (the pattern,)
it will match any character during a rewrite, not just another of its own kind.
Whereever this character appears in the right-hand side of the rule (the substitution,)
it will not replace the corresponding character in the playfield when a substitution
is made.  That character in the playfield will remain unchanged.</p>
